    <div class="container center">
      <p>The Renaissance is a period in European history, covering the span between the 14th and 17th centuries
        and marking the transition from the Middle Ages to modernity. The traditional view focuses more on the early
        modern aspects of the Renaissance and argues that it was a break from the past, but many historians today focus
        more on its medieval aspects and argue that it was an extension of the middle ages.</p>
